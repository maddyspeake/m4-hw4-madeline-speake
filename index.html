                <p class="about">
                    You may know of Antoni Gaudí without awareness of his name, as I did; the Spanish architect's work is immediately recognizable  
                    as emblematic of Barcelona and its unique funkiness. His individual style of art nouveau, Catalan Modernism, incorporates 
                    nature-inspired elements in a fantastical fashion that invokes a sort of mystic experience. This synthesis of the 
                    organic and the holy stems much from his childhood. During bouts of poor health, he stayed in a country home 
                    where he developed a strong religiosity and passion for the wonders of the environment where he convalesced. 
                    You'll be hard-pressed to find many straight lines among his architecture, as the ceramic, ironwork, and stained glass components 
                    of his constructions mimic the free-flowing essence of the natural world. The shapes of his buildings ebb and flow as the 
                    ocean might. The entirety of his iconic work is protected by UNESCO as World Heritage sites to preserve them for generations
                    to come. I hope this page will inspire you to make a visit to one of his truly awe-inspiring dwellings.

                    In 1883, Gaudí took on the construction of Sagrada Familia from an architect who began it one year before, and would continue 
                    his work on it for the rest of his life - in fact, it is still unfinished, and he himself is buried in its crypt. In discussing
                    the inordinately long construction time of the church, Gaudí is said to have stated that his client (God), was not in a hurry. &#128521;
                    The original design was meant to be Gothic, but upon Gaudí's taking of the reins, the idiosyncratic artist overhauled the 
                    design to more of his distinctive style. The multitude of spires of the building, which are evocative of a dripping sandcastle,
                    are meant to represent the Twelve Apostles, the Four Evangelists, the Virgin Mary, and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ
                    (though his has yet to be constructed). The interior is structured as that of a five-pointed Latin cross, and the columns within
                    are all of Gaudí's original design, meant to produce constantly moving refractions of light from the windows of the basilica.
                    His lifetime project continues under the mantle of others to this day; someday yet we may see his brainchild as he imagined it.

                        The aristocratic Batlló family, unhappy with the current look of their well-located Barcelona residence, 
                        commissioned Gaudí to redesign their home, what is now known as the Casa Batlló. Its nickname is the <i>Casa dels
                        Ossos</i>, the House of Bones, owing to the exterior's facade reminscence of skeletal features. Indeed, the house 
                        does seem alive - it is even ventilated in a lung-like fashion through the two wells of the home. Comparisons of the
                        building to a dragon are also made, substantiated by the spine-like appearance of the roof, and the ribcage-like arches
                        beneath it. The coloring and light refraction within also evoke an oceanic feel inside, with the windows' natural 
                        lighting playing off of the blues and greens of the mosaic tile throughout. Today the residence has been repurposed 
                        as a museum, allowing for all to experience its abstract majesty and muse on what it must have been like to live in 
                        such an astounding piece of art.

                <p class="park">
                    Park Güell is another of Gaudí's creations that began with residentiary purposes, originating as the pavillion of 
                    the eponymous Eusebi Güell's Barcelona property. Guell envisioned a housing development within the natural park and 
                    enlisted the help of Gaudí and his mentor Joan Martorell to build out houses in the area. Ultimately only two homes were actualized in the park, but Gaudí and Martorell were able to flesh out more of the vision with public spaces and paths that 
                    formed a municipal garden for the city. The two centered the park around a main terrace, where one is led by a dragon 
                    stairway. The dragon, or salamander, is known as a hallmark symbol of Catalonia. Viaducts around the park similar to the sandcastle-y look of Sagrada Familia guide guests around in a meandering, peaceful fashion. The architecture's ability to ingratiate itself with the land around it may make you feel as if it was formed that way naturally, as Gaudi intended.
